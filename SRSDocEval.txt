This is a good start, and you have captured many important items about
your project.  I can see that there are a lot of things you have thought
through.

You can ALWAYS specify more.  Try to think in terms of "if someone else
were to code this project, what would they need to know about the way it
operates?  What information could I provide them so they can be successful
in the implementation?

Reminder: VERY specific language in requirements.  Any time you specify a
requirement there needs to be the word "shall" in the statement, and it
needs to be numbered.  If you have "will" or "should" in a statement, it
must NOT be numbered, and needs to have a numbered requirement immediately
above it -- they go together.

Your document needs a little re-work because of these things.  Fix the
language and add a few more requirements.  For example, you can specify
more about the Causal Inference agent.  What is the algorithm used?
What is the training data like?  What is the selection of "mini-games"
and how is the one that runs picked?  Is there a minimum or maximum number
of times the training will be run?


Otherwise, nice work!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 14.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              27.18 out of 28.18 points = 96.45% which is an A

Keep it up!
